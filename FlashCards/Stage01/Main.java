/**
 * Description A flashcard is a digital or paper card that contains a term on
 * one side, and a definition, translation, or explanation of that term on the
 * other. Flashcards are often used for learning foreign languages and are an
 * effective study technique for many people.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * An example of a flashcard. The upper part is the term the user is being
 * asked, the lower part is the correct answer. Source: Wikipedia.
 * 
 * For this project, weâ€™ll refer to the text on the front of the card as the
 * term, and the text on the back will be the definition. There won't actually
 * be any visual "front" and "back" side of a card: it'll all be done through
 * sequential text. We'll ask the user for the definitions of the terms they
 * previously entered, and check whether the given answers are correct. While
 * developing this application, you will not only learn some programming but
 * also save paper!
 * 
 * Objectives Implement a program that outputs 4 lines:
 * 
 *  - The first line is Card: 
 *  - The second line is the term on the front of the card
 *  - The third line is Definition: 
 *  - The fourth line is the definition on the back of the card 
 *  
 * In this stage, the term and the definition can be anything you want.
 * 
 * Examples Here are some output examples to clarify what the result should look
 * like.
 * 
 * Example 1.
 * 
 * Card: 
 * purchase 
 * Definition: 
 * buy 
 * 
 * Example 2.
 * 
 * Card: 
 * cos'(x) 
 * Definition: 
 * -sin(x)
