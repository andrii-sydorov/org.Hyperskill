E-mail address
Suppose you are writing a program to match an e-mail address. The rules for email addresses are:

The e-mail username can consist of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters, digits and symbols _%+-..
The domain name (the part that comes after the @ symbol in an e-mail address) can consist only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.
The e-mail domain should include a subdomain and a top-level domain.
Here are some valid examples:

bob.smith@gmail.com

anna@example.ru

kat9%yy+@subdomain.topleveldomain

Which of the following regexes can help you write this program?

^[a-zA-Z0-9_%+-.]+@[a-zA-Z]+\\.[a-zA-Z]+$
