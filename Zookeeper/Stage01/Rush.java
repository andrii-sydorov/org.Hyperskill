/**
 * Stage 1/4: Rush into print
 * 
 * Description
 * 
 * You need Java 17 to complete this project since it uses Text Blocks feature
 * that is not present in Java 11. Remember to choose Java 17 when opening the
 * project in the IDE.
 * There are many animals in the zoo, and all of them need care. The animals
 * must be fed, cleaned, surrounded by their kin, and kept happy. That is a
 * difficult task for our large zoo, so one of your employers has suggested a
 * more convenient way to keep track of everything. She wants to be able to pull
 * up a video feed of any animal in the zoo with the help of a program. Being
 * able to check on each habitat would help the zookeepers take care of our
 * furry friends more efficiently!
 * 
 * In this project, you will create a program that helps the zookeepers check on
 * the animals and make sure that they're doing well. Your product will be able
 * to process commands from the zookeepers and display the animals on a monitor.
 * 
 * Objectives
 * 
 * To begin with, you will develop a simple printer. Your program should display
 * the text from the output example.
 * 
 * Example
 * 
 * The output:
 * 
 * I love animals!
 * Let's check on the animals...
 * The deer looks fine.
 * The bat looks happy.
 * The lion looks healthy.
