/**
 * Stage 1/5: Unfair computer
 * 
 * 1. Description
 * 
 * Rock paper scissors is a popular hand game. Two players simultaneously form
 * one of three shapes with their hands, and then, depending on the shapes, one
 * player wins â€” rock beats scissors, paper wins over rock, scissors defeats
 * paper.
 * The game is well-known for fair win-conditions between equal options.
 * 
 * Let's start with an unfair version! :)
 * 
 * Write a program that reads input that states which option users have chosen.
 * After this, your program must make users lose! That is, your program should
 * always select an option that defeats the one picked by users. Once it finds
 * this option, output the line Sorry, but the computer chose <option>, where
 * <option> is the name of the option that the program's picked depending on the
 * user's input.
 * For example, if users enter rock, the program should print Sorry, but the
 * computer chose paper and so on.
 * 
 * Pay attention to the format of the output. It should follow the one in the
 * example, including capital letters and punctuation. Do not print additional
 * strings.
 * 
 * Just think about it: in this stage, the computer has to win every time.
 * 
 * if users choose paper, the computer chooses scissors (the computer wins);
 * 
 * if users choose scissors, the computer chooses rock (the computer wins);
 * 
 * if users choose rock, the computer chooses paper (the computer wins).
 * 
 * 2. Objectives
 * 
 * Your program should:
 * 
 * Take input from the user;
 * 
 * Find an option that wins over the user's option;
 * 
 * Output the line: Sorry, but the computer chose <option>.
 * 
 * Examples
 * The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input.
 * Note that it's not part of the input.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * > scissors
 * Sorry, but the computer chose rock
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * > paper
 * Sorry, but the computer chose scissors
