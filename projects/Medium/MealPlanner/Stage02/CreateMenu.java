/**
 * Stage 2/6: Create a menu
 * 
 * $1. Description
 * 
 * One meal is not going to get you far! Let's create the main menu to add
 * several meals and display their properties. For this, we need to add a few
 * commands:
 * 
 * - <b>Add</b> starts the meal input process and prompts users for the meal
 *   properties;
 * - <b>Show</b> prints the list of saved meals with their names, categories,
 *   and ingredients;
 * - After executing <b>add</b> or <b>show</b>, the program should ask what
 *   users want to do next;
 * - The program must run until users input <b>exit</b> â€” the command that
 *   terminates the program.
 * 
 * In this stage, your program should also check the user input. What if users
 * enter something wrong?
 * 
 * - If the input meal category is something other than <b>breakfast</b>,
 *   <b>lunch</b>, or <b>dinner</b>, print <b>Wrong meal category! Choose from: breakfast, lunch,
 *   dinner.</b> and prompt users for input;
 * - If the meal's name or ingredients have a wrong format (for example, there
 *   are numbers or non-alphabet characters; ingredients are blank, and so on), print
 *   <b>Wrong format. Use letters only!</b> and prompt users for input. Meal's
 *   name or ingredients containing several words like "peanut butter" should not be
 *   matched as wrong format.
 * 
 * $2. Objectives
 * 
 * To complete this stage, the program must comply with the following
 * requirements:
 * 
 * 1. Create an infinite loop of your program that can be terminated with the
 *    <b>exit</b> command only;
 * 2. Prompt users to choose an operation with the message <b>What would you
 *    like to do (add, show, exit)?</b>
 * 3. After the command has been processed, ask for another operation;
 * 4. Make sure that the input and output formats are correct;
 * 5. If users want to <b>add</b> a meal, follow the sequence from the previous
 *   stage. Don't forget to validate input as explained above. Output <b>The meal
 *   has been added!</b> before proceeding;
 * 6. If users want to <b>show</b> the meals when no meals have been added,
 *    print <b>No meals saved. Add a meal first.</b> If there are meals that can be dislayed, print
 *    them in the order they've been added, following the format from Stage 1;
 * 7. Print <b>Bye!</b> and end the program once the <b>exit</b> command is
 *    entered;
 * 8. If users fail to input a valid command, print the following message again:
 *    <b>What would you like to do (add, show, exit)?</b>
 * 
 * $3. Examples
 * 
 * The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input.
 * Note that it's not part of the input.
 * 
 * Example 1: standard execution
 * 
 * What would you like to do (add, show, exit)?
 * > add
 * Which meal do you want to add (breakfast, lunch, dinner)?
 * > lunch
 * Input the meal's name:
 * > salad
 * Input the ingredients:
 * > lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, olives
 * The meal has been added!
 * What would you like to do (add, show, exit)?
 * > add
 * Which meal do you want to add (breakfast, lunch, dinner)?
 * > breakfast
 * Input the meal's name:
 * > oatmeal
 * Input the ingredients:
 * > oats, milk, banana, peanut butter
 * The meal has been added!
 * What would you like to do (add, show, exit)?
 * > show
 * 
 * Category: lunch
 * Name: salad
 * Ingredients:
 * lettuce
 * tomato
 * onion
 * cheese
 * olives
 * 
 * Category: breakfast
 * Name: oatmeal
 * Ingredients:
 * oats
 * milk
 * banana
 * peanut butter
 * 
 * What would you like to do (add, show, exit)?
 * > exit
 * Bye!
 * 
 * Example 2: invalid input format
 * 
 * What would you like to do (add, show, exit)?
 * > show
 * No meals saved. Add a meal first.
 * What would you like to do (add, show, exit)?
 * > new meal
 * What would you like to do (add, show, exit)?
 * > meal
 * What would you like to do (add, show, exit)?
 * > add
 * Which meal do you want to add (breakfast, lunch, dinner)?
 * > dessert
 * Wrong meal category! Choose from: breakfast, lunch, dinner.
 * > lunch
 * Input the meal's name:
 * > burger1
 * Wrong format. Use letters only!
 * >
 * Wrong format. Use letters only!
 * > soup
 * Input the ingredients:
 * > carrots, ginger, coconut milk, 123
 * Wrong format. Use letters only!
 * > carrots, ginger, coconut milk, curry
 * The meal has been added!
 * What would you like to do (add, show, exit)?
 * > exit
 * Bye!
